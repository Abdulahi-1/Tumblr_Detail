# TumblrDetail

Submitted by: Abdulahi Abdi

Tumblr Detail  is an app that builds upon a Tumblr feed interface by allowing users to tap on a post to view more details, such as the full image and description, on a new screen. It demonstrates navigation, UI construction, and data passing between view controllers in iOS using Swift and Storyboard.

## Notes

A challenge I faced was ensuring the Detail View Controller received the correct data and displayed it accurately.  
I resolved this by carefully setting up the `prepare(for:sender:)` method to pass the selected postâ€™s data to the Detail View Controller and double-checking that the IBOutlets were properly connected to the Storyboard. The outcome was that the correct image and description appeared consistently in the detail view, which improved both the functionality and the user experience of the app.
